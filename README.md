This dataset is related to the operation of a hydrogen electrolyzer, capturing various parameters during its function. The data consists of several key variables measured during the electrolysis process:

Voltage (V): Represents the electrical potential applied across the electrolyzer, which is crucial for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.
Current (A): Indicates the electrical current flowing through the electrolyzer, correlating with the rate of hydrogen production.
Temperature (°C): The operational temperature of the electrolyzer, which can affect the efficiency and safety of the hydrogen production process.
Hydrogen Pressure (bar) and Oxygen Pressure (bar): These columns measure the pressure of hydrogen and oxygen gases produced in the electrolyzer, respectively. Pressure management is important for safe operation and storage.
Hydrogen Flow Rate (Nm³/h) and Oxygen Flow Rate (Nm³/h): These measure the flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen gases being produced, which are critical for assessing the output efficiency of the system.

The dataset includes numerical values for these variables, which are likely collected at regular intervals during the operation of the electrolyzer, providing insights into its performance, operational stability, and efficiency. 
Such data is valuable for optimizing the production process, understanding the impact of different operating conditions, and ensuring safety in hydrogen production.
